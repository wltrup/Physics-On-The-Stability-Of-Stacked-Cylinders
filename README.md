# On The Stability Of Stacked Cylinders

A little exercise on elementary Newtonian mechanics to find out the minimum coefficient of friction required for a stack of cylinders not to collapse.

I have a complete solution for the case of 2 layers of statcked cylinders and have yet to tackle the case of more layers so this is still work in progress.
